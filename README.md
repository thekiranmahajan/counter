I'm thrilled to share that I've just created a fantastic React counter using the useState Hook, and it's all thanks to the incredible "Chai aur React" series on YouTube by the one and only Hitesh Choudhary sir! 🙌

This nifty little counter not only utilizes the power of React but also adheres to a very specific limit - the age limit! It counts from 0 all the way up to 22, and I couldn't be more thrilled about the results. 

I've also added some extra interesting features to it as I also give my own touch to the projects I do 😎


I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Hitesh Choudhary sir for his awesome series that made this possible. 🙏 His content is not just informative but also incredibly engaging and fun.

If you're looking to level up your React skills, his channel is the place to be.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects and learning adventures ahead! 🚀
